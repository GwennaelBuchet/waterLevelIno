# Water-Level Ino
A water-level sensor for Coffee Machine, made with Arduino.

It's based on :
- 1 Arduino nano
- 1 e-Tape from MILONE Technologies
- 1 Adafruit SSD1306 display (I2C 32x128 OLED)
- 1 red led

## AIM
 The e-tape detects level of water in the water tank and display current percent on SSD1306.
 When level is critically low (it's truly critical if it's not possible to make a coffee), the red led is on.
